Setup
First we need to alter the Raspberry Piâ€™s config file to enable the 1 wire interfacing (use by this sensor).

Open /boot/config.txt with your favorite text editor
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
canAdd the following line to the bottom of the file
dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=4
You should also load in the device kernel modules by running the following
sudo modprobe w1-gpio
sudo modprobe w1-therm
Testing the sensor
Open your terminal at the location of the temperature sensor.
cd /sys/bus/w1/devices
Write the command ls to list out all w1 devices. you will see an alpha numeric similar to 28-0314977912af, this number is the serial number of your sensor. You must cd into this directory with cd 28-0314977912af.
Next, we have to list out the contents of the file named w1_slave.
cat w1_slave
You will get an output similar to this
dd 01 55 05 7f a5 a5 66 81 : crc=81 YES
dd 01 55 05 7f a5 a5 66 81 t=29812
The number that follows t=is the temperature in micro degree celcius (10^-3).
